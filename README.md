## Introduction
In this project, we analysed [Austin Animal Center Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes/data?select=aac_intakes_outcomes.csv), which contains 80 thousand rows, 41 columns with information like petsâ€™ breed, age, color, which are features that may influence their adoption result, and an adoption result column.

We used EDA, linear regression, logistical regression, and other types of non-linear regression to determine which features are most important in predicting which pets are more likely to be adopted from a shelter, as well as how long they will stay in the shelter. We also did some other interesting analysis, like Euthanasia.

The project's insights and predictive models can enhance targeted marketing by focusing on animals with lower adoption rates, guide resource allocation to support harder-to-adopt animals, and inform policies like adjusting adoption fees or special programs in shelters.

## Code
The code is present in ```outcome_predictions.py```

Jupyter notebook file is ```main.ipynb```

To reproduce results, run:
```python3 outcome_predictions.py```


## Environment Setup
You may need to install the dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
